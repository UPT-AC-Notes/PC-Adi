- The C programming language can generate **pseudo-random** numbers (they depend on a seed).
	- As a seed, we can use the elapsed time since ``epoc`` (1 jan 1980 - first linux kernel started)
	- To achieve this use ``srand(time(NULL))`` 
		- This requires ``time.h`` and ``stdlib.h`` libraries
		- The seed should only be initialised once, at the beginning of the main function.
		- Since time since ``epoc`` is returned in seconds, programs that are executed with a delta time of less than a second will have the same seed, hence return the same random numbers.
- The only example of so-called "true random" generators are quantum generators.
